Names: Logan Walsh, Zachary Rose

This is a program that organizes a list of movies into a sorted list and allows the user to search, add, and remove movies from the list, as well as read from and print to a file.

## Required Files
* main.cpp --> The main driver, used to test the deque
* deque.h --> The Header file for the deque class
* deque.cpp --> Contains the written functions for the deque class
* Makefile --> Used to compile all of the files
* README.md --> A mythical file that is speculated to explain what a program is for

## Compilation instructions

Type "make" to compile the program.

## Program usage.
*User can input the number of coordinates in the queue in main for testing

To launch the program, type "./deque"

## Design Decisions

## Challenges
*Figuring out how the Deque would work with a 2D Array was hard due to a lack of a solid in-class example.
*Some of the initial drafts of the functions could lead to memory leaks, ways to prevent these had to be found.

## Work Distribution
Logan wrote the initial structure for the class as well as most of the documentation, while Zachary finished off most of the implementation. We worked together to finish any remaining functions, the test cases and made any changes we felt were necessary.
